## Compilation vs. Interpretation 

|                    | Compilation                                                                                                                         | Interpretation                                                                                                                                       |

| **Advantages**     | ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Execution of the translated code is usually faster. <br> ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Only the user needs the compiler ‚Äì the end-user does not. <br> ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ The translated code is stored in machine language, making it hard to reverse-engineer or copy. | ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ You can run the code as soon as you complete it ‚Äì no translation phase needed. <br> ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Code is stored in a programming language, not machine code, so it can be run on multiple architectures without recompiling. |
| **Disadvantages**  | ‚Ä¢ ‚ùå Compilation can be time-consuming ‚Äì changes can‚Äôt be tested instantly. <br> ‚Ä¢ ‚ùå You need a compiler for each target hardware platform. | ‚Ä¢ ‚ùå Code runs slower ‚Äì it shares CPU time with the interpreter. <br> ‚Ä¢ ‚ùå Both you and the user must have the interpreter installed.                    |

## What is it?

- **Python is an interpreted language**, so it inherits the pros and cons of interpretation.
- To run Python code, you need the **Python interpreter** ‚Äì but **Python is free**, which is a huge plus.

## Scripting Languages

Languages intended for interpretation are often called **scripting languages**, and their code is known as **scripts**.

Python has two major competitors:

- **Perl** ‚Äì a traditional scripting language by Larry Wall.
- **Ruby** ‚Äì a more modern scripting language by Yukihiro Matsumoto.

> Python sits somewhere between Perl‚Äôs conservatism and Ruby‚Äôs innovation.

Online communities often debate which is better. It‚Äôs worth exploring all three if you‚Äôre curious.

## üêç Python 2 vs. Python 3

Python 2 and Python 3 are **not compatible**.

- Python 2 code **won‚Äôt run** in Python 3 without modification.
- You may need to **manually update code** to ensure compatibility.
- This isn‚Äôt usually a full rewrite but requires careful revision.

> **Python 3** is the current and actively evolving version.

## CPython and Other Implementations

The standard Python implementation by the PSF is known as **CPython**.

Other popular Python implementations include:

- **Cython** ‚Äì optimized C extension of Python
- **Jython** ‚Äì Python for the Java platform
- **PyPy** ‚Äì faster Python using Just-In-Time compilation
- **MicroPython** ‚Äì Python for microcontrollers and embedded systems
